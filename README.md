# Fission

A collection of functions and custom operators for function composition, data piping, monadic functions, and some other helpful things.

Mostly an attempt to consolidate my most used ones into one place that has all of these things, as well as provide more flexibility than similiar frameworks.

## What is included:

Operators for `flatMap` (`>>-`, `-<<`)

Operator for `map` (`<^>`)

Operators to pass a parameter into a function (`|>`, `<|`)

Functions `curry` and `uncurry`.

Function `applied` and an operator that uses it `<->`.

Function `apply` and an operator for it `<*>`. 

## Next steps:

1. Better tests (the current ones are not good)
2. A better README (documentation ?)
3. Cocoapods and Carthage support
